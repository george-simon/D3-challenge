# D3-challenge - Data Journalism and D3

### Background
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Challenge
Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as *Healthcare vs. Poverty* or *Smokers vs. Age*.

Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.
